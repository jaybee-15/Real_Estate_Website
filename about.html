    <p>For over 50 years, Nigeria has defined the JayBee Properties market with experienced assurance, bridging carefully curated insights with unrivalled sales strategies and driven agents. We’re more than a real estate firm. We understand the subtleties of each neighborhood ensuring we walk in our values at every interaction. <br><br>
        Master Johnbosco Onyekelu who is the founder, opened the very first office at Old Aba Road, Port-Harcourt at 16 years of age. Johnbosco, as he’s affectionately known, envisioned a specialized boutique agency with a focus on service, details and relationships. Today, Johnbosco’s legacy lives on, as JayBee Properties continues to lead the real estate market. <br><br>
        Every JayBee Properties employee embodies our values of integrity, teamwork, accountability, support and learning. We believe every conversation is an opportunity to deliver greater benefits, learning about ourselves and our clientele in order to refine our market approach. Enduring connections lead to repeatable successes, and it’s the success of our clients that we care about most. 
        Our years of real estate success have shown that continuous growth and development is the key to maintaining our position as JayBee Properties’ premium property agency. While we’ve remained true to Johnbosco’s vision, our expansion has allowed us to embrace the intricacies of a dynamic market, keeping pace with an ever-evolving landscape. <br><br>
